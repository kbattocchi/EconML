class DRtester:

    """
    Validation tests for CATE models. Includes the best linear predictor (BLP) test as in Chernozhukov et al. (2022),
    the calibration test in Dwivedi et al. (2020), and the QINI coefficient as in Radcliffe (2007).

    **Best Linear Predictor (BLP)**

    Runs ordinary least squares (OLS) of doubly robust (DR) outcomes on DR outcome predictions from the CATE model
    (and a constant). If the CATE model captures true heterogeneity, then the OLS estimate on the CATE predictions
    should be positive and significantly different than 0.

    **Calibration**

    First, units are binned based on out-of-sample defined quantiles of the CATE predictions (s(Z)). Within each bin
    (k), the absolute difference between the mean CATE prediction and DR outcome is calculated, along with the
    absolute difference in the mean CATE prediction and the overall ATE. These measures are then summed across bins,
    weighted by a probability a unit is in each bin.

    .. math::

    Cal_G = \sum_k \pi(k) |E[s(Z) | k] - E[Y^{DR | k}|

    Cal_O = \sum_k \pi(k) |E[s(Z) | k] - E[Y^{DR}|

    The calibration r-squared is then defined as

    .. math::

    \mathcal{R^2}_C = 1 - \frac{Cal_G}{Cal_O}

    The calibration r-squared metric is similar to the standard R-square score in that it can take any value
    less than or equal to 1, with scores closer to 1 indicating a better calibrated CATE model.

    **QINI**

    Units are ordered by predicted CATE values and a running measure of the average treatment effect in each cohort is
    kept as we progress through ranks. The QINI coefficient is then the area under the resulting curve, with a value
    of 0 interpreted as corresponding to a model with randomly assigned CATE coefficients. All calculations are
    performed on validation dataset results, using the training set as input.

    More formally, the QINI curve is given by the following function:

    .. math::

    \tau_{QINI}(q) = Cov(Y^{DR}(g,p), 1\{\hat{\tau}(Z) \geq \hat{\mu}(q)\})

    Where q is the desired quantile, \hat{\mu} is the quantile function, and \hat{\tau} is the predicted CATE function.
    Y^{DR}(g,p) refers to the doubly robust outcome difference (relative to control) for the given observation.

    The QINI coefficient is then given by:

    QINI = \int_0^1 \tau_{QINI}(q) dq

    Parameters
    ----------
    model_regression: estimator
        Nuisance model estimator used to fit the outcome to features. Must be able to implement `fit' and `predict'
        methods

    model_propensity: estimator
        Nuisance model estimator used to fit the treatment assignment to features. Must be able to implement `fit'
        method and either `predict' (in the case of binary treatment) or `predict_proba' methods (in the case of
        multiple categorical treatments).

    n_splits: integer, default 5
        Number of splits used to generate cross-validated predictions

        """
        Calculates QINI coefficient for the given model as in Radcliffe (2007), where units are ordered by predicted
        CATE values and a running measure of the average treatment effect in each cohort is kept as we progress
        through ranks. The QINI coefficient is then the area under the resulting curve, with a value of 0 interpreted
        as corresponding to a model with randomly assigned CATE coefficients. All calculations are performed on
        validation dataset results, using the training set as input.

        Parameters
        ----------
        Zval: (n_val x k) matrix, default ``None''
            Validation sample features for CATE model. If not specified, then `fit_cate' method must already have been
            implemented
        Ztrain: (n_train x k) matrix, default ``None''
            Training sample features for CATE model. If specified, then CATE is fitted on training sample and applied
            to Zval. If specified, then Xtrain, Dtrain, Ytrain must have been specified in `fit_nuisance' method (and
            vice-versa)
        percentiles: one-dimensional array, default ``np.linspace(5, 95, 50)''
            Array of percentiles over which the QINI curve should be constructed. Defaults to 5%-95% in intervals of 5%.
